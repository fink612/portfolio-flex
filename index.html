					<h2>Hello World!</h2> <p>I'm Jared Fink.</p>
					<p>I am a programmer and musician living in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the USA.  I have had over five years
					experience playing music professionally at clubs and events in Top 40 cover bands.  
					I also teach guitar, ukulele and piano to all ages.</p> 
					<p>More recently, I've been working in the 
					natural foods grocery and deli industry, and have had multiple management positions.  I even
					launched a start-up healthier fast food brand that I do want to bring to fruition after
					the pandemic.   But right now, I'm focusing on software development and web design!  I am 
					looking to take my uniquely varied work experience and apply the skills I've learned to the
						exciting field of technology to help change to world for the better.</p>

		      		<h3>About Me</h3>
		     			 <p>Born in the mid 80s, I've seen technology change quite a bit over the years.
					From the Coleco Vision and Apple IIc, through the dawn of the CD-Rom and the birth of home internet, 
		      			up to the 
					modern day of everyone having a device in their pocket magnitudes more powerful than 
		      			the entire computational output of NASA during the moon missions, people my age have 
		      			a special lens on the progress of where computers are taking us.</p>

				 <h3>Nothing beats teamwork</h3> <p>With the right TEAM, work can be a DREAM.  There's been
		      			a handful of times when I've felt like the team I'm working with really clicked.
		      			My desire is to facilitate that feeling of openess and mutual respect no matter where I am.  
		      			As a junior developer with years of management experience, I'm hoping to use my 
		      			communication skills to <i>truly hear</i>, primarily, but also to <i>be heard</i> when needed.</p>

					<h3>Just a human being</h3>
					<p>Outside of work, I enjoy taking in as much nature as possible.  I enjoy walking in the woods with
		      			my family (my wife and dog and soon to be a little baby!)  We frequently visit the great lakes 
		      			and surrounding natural areas.  We also like to play music together, and joke that someday we're
		      			going to <q>hit the road</q> with the family band!  Maybe for retirement...</p>

				<h3>Temp-O-Matic</h3>
				<p>The Temp-O-Matic is a programmable thermometer that allows the user to record the temperature of food cooling at customizable increments.
					Many restaurants and food businesses rely on certain proceedures to cool food quickly to avoid bacterial growth.  This
					device takes a temperature reading every interval and records it to internal memory.  It beeps and sends a notification to 
					a computer via email or text message if the food is not on track to cool safely so other methods can be implemented.</p>

				 <h3>Food Finder</h3>
				 <p>Food Finder is a freely downloadable app that helps people with extra food find people that are hungry.  In recent months, the COVID-19 
					 pandemic has brought to light the issue of food insecurity in every neighborhood.  Also, people that are hungry can't always afford
					 technology or have the resources to find food giveaway events.  Food Finder addresses these issues by connecting people that have 
					 just a small amount of food to share at the time of cooking.</p>

				 <h3>EZ Inventory</h3>
				 <p>Inventory management at a restaurant or deli can be a pain!  That's why I invented EZ Inventory, an app that integrates a barcode database
					 with your business' inventory spreadsheet.  No more pen and paper tours followed by hours of computer work.  How many times
					 have you asked in frustration <q>WHY ISN'T THERE AN APP FOR THIS??!?</q>  Well, now there is!</p>
