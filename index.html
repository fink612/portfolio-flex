					<p class="intro">Hello World!  I'm Jared Fink.</p>
					<P>I would like to get to know you better.  How are you 
						doing today?  Tell me about your experience on 
						this beautiful planet.  I've had a few experiences 
						myself, come to think of it.  I bet If we took the
						time, we'd find some common ground and even some
						shared aspirations.  We're just humans.</p>
					<p>It's a crazy time to be alive, for sure.  There's 
						so many changes happening all at once.  Some good, some bad.  
						Most can't be judged on a such a binary metric. 
						Hopefully, we can figure it before it's too late.
